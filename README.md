# Yearly Summary and Growth Rates
•	On average, there were 27,000 sales each year, generating an annual revenue of approximately $7 million, with the average order value standing at $254. The year 2021 recorded the peak in sales volume at 36,000, whereas 2020 had the highest average order value at $300.

•	The year 2020 experienced a significant growth rate in total sales, order count and AOV, achieving over twice the sales volume and total revenue compared to 2019. Although 2021 saw an increase in the number of sales, the overall revenue declined as customers opted for items that were, on average, 15% less expensive than those purchased in 2020.


## Regional Trends
•	In all regions, 2020 saw the highest growth rate in total sales, nearly doubling both sales numbers and revenue compared to 2019. This shows that growth was driven by a global macroeconomic factor, which was the Covid-19 pandemic. Total sales revenue and volumes in March 2020 were approximately 50% higher than in February 2020, coinciding with the pandemic’s onset. 

•	The LATAM and APAC regions show significantly lower total sales revenue and volumes compared to other regions, despite comparable average order values. Furthermore, the APAC region has the highest AOV of all the regions. This suggests increased competition in these areas and highlights the need to enhance customer base, product offering and brand awareness.

•	In 2022, total sales revenue and volumes declined sharply by approximately 50% and 40%, respectively, due to the global semiconductor chip shortage. As semiconductor chips are essential for all T4Tech products, this shortage led to severe supply constraints despite high demand.
